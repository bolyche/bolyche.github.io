# My Personal Space

Welcome to my personal home page and blog. You'll find it currently at https://bolyche.github.io/

The homepage has links off at the top right to useful places like LinkedIn, Twitter, Goodreads etc. It's possibly actually more for me to remember my accounts than for anyone else. You can find me almost anywhere by searching for `bolyche` (except places like instagram where other people beat me to the handle). It'll usually have my name beside the handle.

My blog is a recording of miscellaneous writing. Feel free to browse & engage with me if any are of interest, or if I've written code there which has errors. I love to learn and I am by no means infallable. 


## Running & Updating

### Set up Ruby, Jekyll etc

This site uses Jekyll so follow their instructions to get up and running. Installation instructions per whichever operating system you're using - [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

You'll note that we're using a Gemfile which occasionally needs updating for the gems used. You can serve the site using
