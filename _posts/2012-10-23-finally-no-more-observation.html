<p>"The age of passive sponging is nigh!" -&gt; A cry I would thoroughly love heard resonated throughout cafes, campuses and offices.</p>
<p>A pattern I've noticed over the last near-quarter decade, is the inimitably sheepish cycle the majority of humans entrench themselves in during their lifetimes. We're born (oh the old adage we're born, we eat, we shit, we die.. (and some of us even fuck)), but then instead of grasping life experiences, we mosey through them, coast from that amoral philosophical childhood, to angsty tweenness and ultimately sombre, respectable adults. With the information age there seems to be a phenomenon of "shifting" feelings/ thoughts/ data. Much less nowadays we create outside of a work-based environment.. it's all going digital, but just like servers we host, we transmit to others, we just shift  along.</p>
<p>That is to say, if I'm not being clear: We accept information, we retweet factlets and chuckle at research stories but most of us DON'T write our own stories, do our own research or write our own sources. Unless you're already an active blogger yourself, you're probably one of those people who started one.. oh say, 2 years ago --- &amp; you're totally still going to do that post! ("You just wait.. the perfect moment will arise when the inner author will burst out and intrigue people with my thoughts")</p>
<p>Perhaps a large reason for this is that we know in the back of our minds, that the internet (only recently such a fragile and exciting thing) is already full to the brim. Who needs another post about how your boss made an excellent joke about African-based watersnakes and an unfortunate mime? Or an update on the regularity of your bowel movements coinciding with eating blue cheese? Nobody of course (because of course that is what twitter is for: condense the condensable, relegate the butt of your experience to a minor infraction on other's lives - if it's smaller, they're more likely to read it).</p>
<p>We've sort of deduced from the pre-existing morass that it's almost impossible to be original, unless you're working in a developing field (in which case if you're not original, you're likely to be sued). The common joke that 'if you've thought of it; there's porn of it' extends further into the presupposition that if you've thought of ANYTHING then it already exists. And thus, we avoid putting ourselves through the act of creation, because frankly, "what's the point?".</p>
<p>To me this is sad. So many people I know sit huddled by their computer, absorbing innumerable answers to questions they never even posed. Quora is a prime example of this - Sure, if you're the one asking the question then the answer is relatively important to you. But who do you know out of your fellow browsers who has? - none that I know of - and yet, many of us sit reading through it, entranced like babies in <a class="zem_slink" title="Babel" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/babel" target="_blank" rel="rottentomatoes">Babel</a>'s library at all the knowledge, storing it up for future retelling to our friends and coworkers. As I said: nodes. We are then but nodes in a system transferring god-knows-what emotion.</p>
<p>So in effect to summarise: little do we now engage in conversations -debating-, <em>without data references</em>. We transmit information. We absorb it. We transmit some more. We eat some pie. We chuckle at some news. Transmit some more..transmit transmit..</p>
<p>I started this blog in part because I'm frustrated by my own lack of participating in active, challenging thought-creativeness. So often I've just pasted links to a blog that I believe summarises my thoughts better than I can do so myself - it's a flimsy, foolish way out - a reliance on the world to already possess the answer I need, for a solution to already be in existence. We'll see if I can change this reliance on the internet (whilst using the internet..). Becoming a maker, a doer.. &amp; at the very least, a thoroughly horrendous poet.</p>
<p>Looking forward to it.</p>
