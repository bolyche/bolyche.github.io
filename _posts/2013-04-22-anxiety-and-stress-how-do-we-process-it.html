<p>While I submitted this to the OBR annual science writing competition, my mad dash in completing a fevered keyboard-dance a few hours before the competition deadline (having not pencilled it into my calendar, I got home from work to discover whilst browsing I had a few hours to submit something) leads me to suspect there'll be no accolades for this :)</p>
<p><em>Particularly since I discovered that my post uncannily resembles one of th</em><em>e Nature articles I used to find the research papers I wanted. Alas - they are included below to compare. </em>But still - enjoy reading this hasty foray into the feedback loops of anxiety!</p>
<p>However, <strong>WARNING: Technical terms follow.</strong></p>

<p>Who of us haven’t experienced intense anxiety? We deal with it at work, with our family. We experience it in media and films, re-living the confusing panic in The Truman Show and the vexing, anxious worry of The Aviator or our favourite crime thriller. The menacing sense of unease – those tensed up muscles, headaches, heart palpitations. For Americans research showed anxiety to be a genuinely debilitating condition for about a third of people, at some stage in their lives – A serious problem by any standards and one induced due to surprisingly sparse reasons (as much as we’d love to imagine our problems equivalent to the brilliant Kevin McCallister’s in Home Alone). While the short-term reactions to fear are natural reactions: take the increased exam-vigilance of the undergraduate student; we still understand little behind the mechanisms that underpin the extended anxiety-epidemic that seems to affect humans.</p>
</div>
<p>Recent studies in Nature journal looked into how we process these anxieties. While the amygdala (a small almond-shaped group of nuclei in the brain’s medial temporal lobes shown to process memory and emotional reactions) is thought to be a major gateway in our fear expression, research examines how our fear plays out through the brain. One interesting finding found that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a central part of a fibre band acting as one of the key output pathways from the amygdala to the hypothalamus (which serves as a veritable bedlam of functions) plays a contrary role. While we might predict the harmony of a ‘push-pull’ mechanism in biology, it’s surprising to find two subregions of the BNST giving opposite effects on anxiety. While one region guns for increased risk-avoidance and increased respiratory rate, the other actively counteracts it. These regions are accompanied with the ventral BNST, which hosts another flock of neurons: with these neurons, producing anxiety and reducing motivation gained from reward can be done by exposing mice to anxiety-causing environments: this stimulates anxiety causing neurons, yet inhibits anxiety-reducing neurons: no contradicting mechanism!</p>
<p>Such circuit mechanisms for giving us our eventual state of emotional discomfort are found to be increasingly complex: initial studies demonstrated certain neuronal populations and subpopulations decreased fear of certain environments, altered motivational-based actions and the responses to stress. Breaking down further we can find which regions reduce our anxiety-based respiration problems or our aversion to fear-inducing areas. For example, reducing the firing of the amygdala causes a decrease in letting the mouse distinguish between safe environments, and those that should produce anxiety, suggesting the sub-region that decreases anxiety gets excited following a signal from the amygdala.</p>
<p>While bi-directional and complex, understanding how we use these feedback loops could eventually lead us to understand our anxiety disorders better: instead of panic attacks, we could fix for ourselves improved cues or situational environments that would ameliorate our panic. Right now, the research needs to focus on which subpopulations of neurons affect what, and more importantly why these connections arise: while we might speculate a looping process of fear and anxiety coupled with learning from our fear-circumstance would allow fear-reduction, such a clear-cut neuronal feedback mechanism hasn’t yet been shown.</p>
