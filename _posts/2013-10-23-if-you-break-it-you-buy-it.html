<p style="text-align:right;"><em>In UCL Pi newspaper, print edition. My unedited, unabbreviated version below: A rant on our government's uselessness Re climate change. </em></p>

<p>The science is clear-cut and unequivocal. As humanity continues to pour greenhouse gases into our atmosphere, the calamitous impact that floods, droughts and sea level rises will have is set to be devastating. Having released 54% of our trillion tonne CO<sub>2</sub> limit, a 2<sup>o</sup>C temperature rise by the end of the century is almost certain even with ‘moderate’ emissions.<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/27/climate-change-poor-countries-ipcc"> In places like West Africa</a> this means heavier monsoons; in India, Bangladesh and Burma stronger cyclones; in the UK our temperature extremes will widen and increase rainfall severity as warmer atmospheres hold higher moisture; in places like Australia where a 6<sup>o</sup>C average temperature rise on the hottest days is predicted by the end of the century, mammals, birds and reptile species are set to be lost alongside diversely populated wetlands such as Kakudu.</p>

<p><b>— Peter Gleick, climate &amp; water scientist</b></p></blockquote>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) release of the first part of its fifth assessment report (AR5) on the 27<sup>th</sup> September, the solid reality of climate change and human impact is detailed in a dry, precise documentation of climate breakdown.  Formed in 1988 the IPCC has since investigated climate science as a voluntary body for research reviews, with its reports (every 5-7 years) often facing shrill outcries from climate sceptics and fevered ‘scare-mongering’ accusations by politicians and businesses. This last round of climate investigation, questioned and belligerently scrutinized by 110 governments over 4 days at the Stockholm presentation, represents what is perhaps the largest and most exhaustive peer-reviewed body of evidence of any scientific study led to date. Unlike the 2007 debates, 18 key <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WG1AR5_Headlines.pdf">report headlines</a> were agreed on by all 110 governments which hold the essential points: most simply that “human influence on the climate system is clear” (-Stocker), and it may actually be responsible for <i>all</i> of the climate warming.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"This is not just another report, this is the scientific consensus reached by hundreds of scientists after careful consideration of all the available evidence. The human influence on climate change is clear and dominant. The atmosphere and oceans are warming, the snow cover is shrinking, the Arctic sea ice is melting, sea level is rising, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/climate-change-uk-weather-ipcc">oceans are acidifying</a>, and some extreme events have increased. CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels need to substantial decrease to limit climate change."</i></p>

<blockquote><p><i>"Carbon dioxide has probably not been this high in the atmosphere for 3 million years. We understand the greenhouse effect, so what more information do people want?"</i></p>
<p><b>—</b> <b><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-climate-change-report-ar5-live-coverage">Prof Joanna Haigh</a>, Imperial College London Atmospheric Physics</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Yet as evidential as the million-word+ report is, the governments that decry the oncoming disintegration of our gentle, nurturing climate do little themselves to prevent its destruction. Reaching a global agreement to limit emissions hasn’t occurred to date with the <a href="http://www.nef.org.uk/climatechange/">US, Canada, China, Australia, Russia and India</a> not agreeing to a long term legally binding treaty (full Kyoto protocol) for greenhouse gas reduction. Recklessly our governments continue to invest in <i>getting fossil fuels out of the ground </i>when already our atmosphere can’t afford it. Burning the fossil fuels we currently hold would release nearly 3000 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> – For any chance of coming up under the 2<sup>o</sup>C rise we need to limit our future emissions to 500 gigatonnes CO<sub>2</sub>, yet companies continue to grapple for resources.</p>
<p>We deny, discredit or underplay our role in our climate’s destruction. News stories focus unduly on ‘flaws’ in predictions: the reduction in surface warming 1998-2012 played into sceptics ground, with few notations that contradict their criticism: with the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions and solar radiation fluctuations we’ve still experienced the warmest decade in recorded history. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/01/bbc-coverage-climate-report-ipcc-sceptics">Even BBC news </a>coverage caved to give undue climate sceptics coverage by scientists not qualified to offer an opinion. Climate experts are all for a hearty debate: but when the evidence is there and the opposition is a groundless bigoted view the exercise for ‘equal coverage’ becomes futile.</p>
<p>If we feel like denial is strong amongst journalism, it is even higher amongst those that have a stake in its falsity. Governments and energy companies will concede the issue when pressed, yet<a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2290230/uk-oil-and-gas-investment-reaches-record-high"> this year the UK is investing £13.5 bn</a> for oil and gas extraction, more money than any other sector. Chancellor Osborne<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rt-hon-george-osborne-mp-offshore-europe-conference"> in a September conference</a> praised the oil and gas industry, insisting on increased tax breaks and accelerated development to counter the barrier to increasing extraction cost. Blatantly batting his hands away from acknowledging our need to act on climate change, he argued that avenues such as shale gas from fracking will reduce our energy bills and increase jobs: a claim that has proved false in studies with gains lower than other sectors (see my 'frack-off-indeed’ post for a breakdown of this).</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Not a word in his speech about climate change - Osborne clearly doesn't believe in urgent action on climate change and is putting another nail in the coffin of the UK Climate Change Act"</i></p>
<p><b>—<a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2292362/osborne-talks-up-oil-and-gas-and-renewables">Charles Perry,</a> SecondNature co-founder, former director of BP Green </b></p></blockquote>
<p>As our governments publicly bemoan their fate, they grasp and wheeze to secure foreign resources whilst trying to protect their own. A lack of comprehensive 2030 decarbonisation targets in the Energy Bill passed in June has led to investment uncertainty, with investors representing <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10342818/Green-energy-confusion-stalling-UK-investment.html">£1trillion worldwide assets</a> questioning growth and investment into new manufacturing assets. Meanwhile we trade away carbon sinks and biospheres of our world as we extend our hunt from coal, gas and oil to more difficult sources such as shale, tar sands and methane hydrates.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“The UK has the potential to offer a safe harbour for renewable energy investors in Europe, but the delay in delivering a stable policy framework is weakening our prospects and holding back investment. It is essential that this Government commits to a clear direction of travel towards a decarbonised energy system”</i></p>
<p><b>—<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10342818/Green-energy-confusion-stalling-UK-investment.html-">Ben Warren, EY Partner</a></b></p></blockquote>
<p>It might look bleak, and indeed in a world of climate <b>in-activists</b> it would be. Our financial system depends upon investments such as energy, with capitol (our pensions, basically) ‘locked up’ in the reserves energy companies have valuations for in the form of fossil fuels. Completely stopping extraction could trigger a global financial crisis losing around $4 trillion worth of shares that could make our current depression seem like a sucker punch before buckling in the boxing ring. - But all is not lost. Pressure on governments to invest further in renewables, along with increased research and career investment by people such as yourselves into clean energy may yet turn the tide. We need to act in unison to mitigate a disaster that would ruin food production, bring poverty, death and impede the progress of developing countries. We need to funnel our efforts – we can’t just give in to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/04/global-warming-sceptics-discredit-ipcc?CMP=twt_gu">bribing, the bullying and the childish denial</a> our government hold in response to a human-made problem. Positive action, clear goals: not this hand-wringing and headshaking.</p>
