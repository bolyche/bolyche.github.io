I was having a thought about "know it alls" - how they act without sometimes realising how their reaction can make others feel.

Sometimes someone will (in a good hearted way) think that all their friends, colleagues and family read and know everything they do. Yet on finding otherwise, their surprise (and sometimes skepticism) that their buddies DON'T comes across really badly.

I think I might have been one of these people in my teens. I'm incredibly glad to be more self aware now.

Thinking of all this, I recently obtained a nifty little digital pad for drawing and decided to try sketching out these interactions.
So far my discoveries are: it's terrible, exciting and impossible.

I respect my fellow artists immensely.
