Often I feel frustrated by the huge separation between clothes for men vs women.
I'm all for optimising for body forms.. but why not just do exactly that?

Give me skirts for wide-hipped people.  
Give me gym suits for large breasts and medium dicks.  
Give me trousers with POCKETS.  
Give me pink for boys and girls and everything in between.  
Give me loose and firm and frilly and sharp.  
Give me substantial, regardless of gender.  
Give me equal price, regardless.
