In a previous post I joked about how misleading dynamic assignments of attributes can be when using descriptors like `property`. Something that's a useful way to ensure you don't (accidentally or otherwise) create attributes on the fly is by using `__slots__`.

When you do so you'll override the automatice creation of the class `__dict__` and `__weakref__` and replace it with `__slots__` which is more memory efficient and also less dynamic. 

For example - Say we want an abstract sort of class which we only inherit and don't actually instantiate. You can create a class like `Animal` below doing something trivial (e.g. How about we override things like `__add__` in order to enable adding instances of classes together?)

```python
class Animal():
    __slots__ = ()

    def __init__(self, animal: set = {}, animal_count: int = None) -> None:
        self.animal = set(animal)
        self.animal_count = animal_count
    
    def __add__(self, n) -> None:
        self.animal.update(n.animal)
        n.animal = self.animal

        self.animal_count += n.animal_count
        n.animal_count = self.animal_count

    def __sub__(self, n) -> None:
        self.animal.remove(n.animal)
        n.animal = self.animal

        self.animal_count -= n.animal_count
        n.animal_count = self.animal_count

    def __call__(self) -> None:
        print(f"{self.animal=}, {self.animal_count=}")
```

If I try to create an instance of this class I'll get an error - Because I've set instance attributes within the `__init__` even though none are in the slots, and slots prevents creation of attributes that aren't specified.

```python
x = Animal()
```

```zsh
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "slots3.py", line 36, in <module>
    x = Animal()
        ^^^^^^^^
  File "slots3.py", line 6, in __init__
    self.animal = set(animal)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'Animal' object has no attribute 'animal'
```

On the other hand I can now inherit this class - and I can either call slots - or not.

```python
class A(Animal):
    __slots__ = "animal", "animal_count"

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("a", 1)
    
class B(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("b", 1)
```

In example A we've specified the slots - Note that if you specify one, you'll get an error if you don't specify the rest of the attributes used in the inherited class. 

Now if we call A() we'll see the output of `__call__` and we can see that slots holds what we expect:

```python
a = A()
a()
print(a.__slots__)
```

```zsh
self.animal={'a'}, self.animal_count=1
('animal', 'animal_count')
```

Upon trying `a.__dict__` we'll get an `AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute '__dict__'. Did you mean: '__dir__'?`. Equally, upon trying a dynamic assignment e.g. 

```python
a.foo = "foo"
```

We'll get 

```zsh
AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute 'foo'
```

B on the other hand has no constraints adding attributes and has the expected class dict as per below

```python
b = B()
b()
b.foo = "foo"
print(b.__dict__)
```

Outputting
```zsh
self.animal={'b'}, self.animal_count=1
{'animal': {'b'}, 'animal_count': 1, 'foo': 'foo'}
```

Now, why might we use this? 

There are a few benefits and I admit I find the insurance of knowing which attributes exist to be helpful! But the main one is actually time and memory. 

```python
import sys
import timeit

def check(obj):
    obj.animal = "snake"
    obj.animal
    del obj.animal

print("size a")
print(sys.getsizeof(a))
print("size b")
print(sys.getsizeof(b))
print("time a")
print(min(timeit.repeat('check(a)', globals=globals())))
print("time b")
print(min(timeit.repeat('check(b)', globals=globals())))
```

You see that a is both a bit smaller and a bit faster! Which doesn't matter too much in the grand scale of my example, but can add up 

```zsh
size a
48
size b
56
time a
0.036912125011440367
time b
0.04000041700783186
```
