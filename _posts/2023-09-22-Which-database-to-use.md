When you have a hammer.. everything looks like a nail. Similarly, when you know Postgres.. Postgres is good for all problems right? It's like the proverbial porridge in the 3 Bears childrens story. Not too hot, not too cold. Open source, scales well, many integrations, well maintained... What more could you possibly need?

### Considerations in choosing your DB

To be honest I've known various people guilty of simply choosing the tool they're familiar with - from all walks of seniority and field. Sometimes when you need to implement something quickly, it actually really makes a difference to _know_ all the problems, abilities and inabilities of a chosen tool. To be an expert in one of them takes time and experience - not to be taken for granted!

Often however it really pays to consider your use case and to answer questions such as:

- How much data will you be storing?
- How stable (or volatile) is your data - Or will your data and schemas need to change?
- Is it transactional or analytical processing you need - or both?
- How many simultaneous requests do you expect at peak usage?
- What is your database powering - Is it the backend for an application which varies wildly in peak usage? Does it need to be fault tolerant? 
- How does your database need to integrate with other applications or processes?
- Does it need to span across many geographical zones (and so comply with many different data protection rules)?
- What type of data is it? What is it's structure? Does it have relationships?
- What is the setup and maintenance budget?

### Important terms

There are various terms bandied around when looking at databases so it seems useful to define them or understand a bit more what they mean.

**Latency**:

- The measure of time between the request and response of an application in a network
- When considering end to end latency, this includes the client request, network delays, time used by intermediaries and the database until the response is received
- Latency can increase with increasing throughput due to the database needing more resources to tidy up or due to throttling / bottlenecking elsewhere
- If your database needs to have low latency (e.g. an eCommerce business) then you'll need to understand what this looks like when the throughout is high (and your business is booming!) as often at low throughput systems can easily give low latency.. but this may not scale

**Throughput**:

- Typically the transactions processed per minute (TPM) or per second (TPS)
- Can also be considered in terms of the number of simultaneous requests the system is capable of processing
- Some systems like Cassandra can have a very high throughput whilst having a less optimal latency due to ability to process many concurrent requests per machine, plus the distributed nature allowing high horizontal scaling
- When considering throughput, it's important to consider what you expect your system to handle. Databases set up for analytical processing typically don't need high throughput for example

**ACID**:

ACID compliance should be used when you need your transactions to be processed reliably and guarantee valid data. Standing for 
- Atomicity: A transaction either succeeds entirely for the database or fails with no intermediate state; preventing partial updates in the case of errors, node crashes, power failures or other
- Consistency: Transactions are consistent with database constraints; if the data is invalid or is in an illegal state, the transaction should fail
- Isolatation: Transactions are isolated and don't interfere with each other
- Durability: Transactions that complete persist even in the case of post-transaction errors, node crashes, power failures or other 

It's worth noting that it's not just RDBMS' that are ACID-compliant these days. NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and DynamoDB can also support ACID compliance.


**Vertical scaling**:

- This involves changing your databases resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and potentially networking capacity
- It's generally easy to do and doesn't add complexity
- There is a limit to how much you can scale this way, since there's a physical limit to how much CPU, memory, harddrives and network interfaces can be present on one machine
- Scaling this way may result in downtime if it requires migration between hardware

**Horizontal scaling**:

- This involves adding machines / nodes to your system
- The data can be partitioned or sharded between machines (MongoDB does this) or replicated across many machines (AWS RDS does this for systems such as Postgres)
- It can be complex to manage and maintain
- Sharded databases will be effected by how the data is queried and stored; the way your systems interact with the database would change

**CAP**: 

- This refers to a theory originally proposed by Professor Eric A. Brewer about distributed systems 23 odd years ago
- The acronym represents Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance
- It posits that you have to compromise between Availability and Consistency in a distributed data store, with Availability defined as "every request gets a response" and Consistency as "Every read gets the most recent write"
- These two sound and indeed are mutually exclusive, since when one of your partitions fails, you either have to cancel the operation (losing availability) or continue the operation and have a momentary inconsistency; You can't have a guarantee in both

**OLAP**

- OLAP stands for Online analytical processing
- OLAP dbs are typically optimised for Read and for lower throughput, since the bulk of their processes are in complex queries to produce, access or manipulate multi-dimensional datasets known as OLAP cubes or hypercubes
- The focus on being able to quickly access multiple dimensions thereby makes it very different to the more traditional relational structure of relational databases, particularly as the data is generally hierarchical 
- The main analytical operations are Roll-Ups (aggregates), Drill-Downs (going from a rollup to data split by further dimensions), Slicing and Dicing (subselecting one or multuple dimensions) and Pivoting (Switching the row/column axis of dimensions)
- They're subcategorised by Multidimensional (MOLAP - the usual), Relational (ROLAP) and Hybrid (HOLAP). There's also others such as Real-time, Graph and Context-aware Semantic (with more I'm not mentioning)

- Real-time OLAP: Real time is good for reporting and ad hoc querying, columnar storage & vectorised computations for faster access. 
- If you want real-time OLAP then you may want to consider dbs such as Clickhouse or Apache Pinot ([this is a really nice comparison](https://www.risingwave.com/blog/a-comprehensive-overview-of-top-8-real-time-olap-databases/))
- Streaming OLAP: Streaming is good with pre-defined queries and incremental computations, making these great for alerting.
- If you want streaming OLAP then you can consider dbs such as RisingWave or DeltaStream [this](https://medium.com/@RisingWave_Engineering/top-8-streaming-databases-for-real-time-analytics-a-comprehensive-guide-f45d7b3b35c8)

**OLTP**

- OLTP stands for online transactional processing
- It optimises for realtime transactions such as inserts, updates and deletes on a high throughput and low latency
- High focus on atomicity and consistency
- This makes such databases ideal for typical backends for applications or operational systems

**Massively parallel processing (MPP)**

- Refers to a large number of processors simultaneously performing coordinated computations in parallel
- When we talk about massively parallel in data, we don't mean GPUs or intregrated circuits; We generally mean many machines (nodes) in parallel, each running their own OS and memory, interconnected through a fast network
- The nodes each handle their own workload independently with a messaging interface between them
- As such, an MPP database is one where the processing workload is split between many servers / nodes, resulting in higher efficiency and lower cost vs having a single machine with high CPU
- Grid computing is a type of parallel computing. It's a distributed system with each node being potentially different and performing different tasks in a geographically separated way over a conventional network interface. That is to say, the machines are not necessarily in the same place and since they're connected by e.g. ethernet, the performance and speed of results is unclear. This kind of computing is great for many tiny independent calculations
- Cluster computing is another form of parallel computing. Here, the nodes are more homogenous, less distributed, connected over LANs and set to perform the same task via a centralised management approach. Middleware orchestrates the activities of the nodes and allows you to treat the cluster as one cohesive unit

**Parallelism**

- There are many different uses for the term, but here I will mention parallel computing. This refers to _independent_ subtasks being run as part of a computational task (which is then combined at the end), executed at the same time

**Concurrency**

- Per the above, concurrent computing is when different subtasks are run during overlapping time periods, but can require intercommunication between subtasks to complete the computation and do not execute at exactly the same time

### Decisions

Wouldn't it be grand if there was an up to date flow diagram for how to make such decisions?

In my next post I'll outline various databases of interest (anyone want a time series db?) and mention some interesting benchmarking data I've seen. I'll also go more into choosing your database, which this post is mostly setup for.
